If you've downloaded the source code from Git, there will be
no ./configure file. To create one, make sure you have GNU autotools
installed and execute the following commands:

$ aclocal
$ autoconf
$ automake --add-missing

This will create the ./configure script and other necessary files.
After doing so, follow the instructions from the INSTALL file.
